  <h1>KML Tool</h1>

  <h2 name="description">Description</h2>
  <p><strong>KML Tool</strong> is a program designed to retrieve coordinates from Google Earth's Keyhole Markup Language files (KML).</p>
  <p>The program interface has a very minimalistic interface as shown in the figure. At the top of the program should be the menu bar followed by a field to select a KML. Below there is a button to retrieve coordinates followed by a text field to show the coordinates.</p>
